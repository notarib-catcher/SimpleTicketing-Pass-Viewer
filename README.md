# SIMPLE TICKET PORTAL
***
Developed by Aaryan D of MAHE (MIT) BLR
***

The main goal of this system is to allow for an easy ticket access, verification and seamless event management.

This system is forked from the Solstice ticketing system made for the solstice tech fest The source code for the entire website is 
available [here](https://github.com/notarib-catcher/solstice-msite-sveltk/).
That system is much larger, more complex and designed for more involved deployment and maintenance.

The Solstice solution supports many more features than this one, however, this solution is easier to deploy, host and maintain, even for a
non-technical individual with the help of some basic tutorials and reading the documentation.

This particular repository/project only contains the frontend system responsible for showing ticket 
details to an attendee. The system also includes a Node.js based backend for handling ticket data and a mobile app for 
scanning and verifying tickets.

Authentication is handled by Google Social Sign-on and SvelteKitAuth.

This project is a work in progress. Further documentation will be added as the project itself becomes deployment-ready!
